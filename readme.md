If you are using vscode and using command line for build with maven

1. Use `mvn package` for build the project

2. Use `java -cp <the project you build>.jar <the java file>` to run the file

e.g. `java -cp target/COMP3111LEx-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Lab1.mainApp1`

You may wonder why I don't put it at Lab1 directory, because I also put as well
